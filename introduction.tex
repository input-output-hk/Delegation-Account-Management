\section{Introduction}

In this document we describe the account structure and the process of delegating stake in Cardano SL. We first describe the properties of an account and the general structure of the address that represents it. Next, we describe the certificates that are used for delegation and the necessary assumptions and functionalities that the delegation scheme must cover. Finally, we investigate the usecases for delegation and describe various scenarios that pertain to usecases based on the user's needs.
